# Superscalar-Pipeline-Simulator
It's a simple simulator of a superscalar pipeline.
The input is a list of instructions in assembly MIPS, that show in the last columns, the instructions that the registers deppend in. And you can choose the number of pipelines that you wanna initiate.
The output it's a simulator where you can see the stage that each instruction is in each cycle.
